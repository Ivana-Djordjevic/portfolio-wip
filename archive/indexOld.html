                <!-- for finalized project: ask Serena to design graphics for you
                    current idea (03/26)
                        ask Serena to make a purple cloud npg which cuts at the bottom edge, for element header
                         that way the glitter npg from element div (where my photo is) will look like it's bleeding over from the clouds

                            Nice to meet you, my name is Ivana Djordjevic. <br> 
                            This has yet to be curated. <br>
                            mention where your background stems for and how it's relevant to coding <br>
                            maybe talk about diverse backgroud cuz ppl always seem to be intrigued by it (could help make you stand out admist the pool of candidates)<br>
                            all the details not necessary, make it covert somehow
